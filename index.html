                <p>Nicolae Ceaușescu took the position as president of Romania in 1974, in which he would turn Romania into a self-sufficient country and a rapidly developing nation. He led several ambitious projects, one of which included the establishment of Danube-Black Sea Canal and the Palace of the Parliament. This showcased his vision of modernisation despite high costs making him a determined leader. Furthermore, under his guidance, Ceaușescu’s commitment to education was reflected by the 100% literacy rate that Romania reached by 1989. In addition, his aggressive approach to foreign debt made Romania one of the few but successful socialist nations to pay off its debt early. Though harsh, Ceaușescu’s policies alway put the sovereignty of Romania first, shielding Romania from Soviet and Western influence. His leadership still conveys a symbol of pride and national independence despite the justifiable economic struggles that later followed.
