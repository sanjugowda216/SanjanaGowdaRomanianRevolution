                <p>Nicolae Ceaușescu took the position as president of Romania in 1974, in which he would turn Romania into a self-sufficient country and a rapidly developing nation. He led several ambitious projects, one of which included the establishment of the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the Palace of the Parliament. This showcased his vision of modernization despite the high costs, which made him a determined leader. Furthermore, under his guidance, Ceaușescu’s commitment to education was reflected by the 100% literacy rate that Romania reached by 1989. In addition, his aggressive approach to foreign debt made Romania one of the few prosperous socialist nations to pay off its debt early. Though harsh, Ceaușescu’s policies always put the sovereignty of Romania first, shielding Romania from Soviet and Western influence. His leadership still conveys a symbol of pride and national independence despite the justifiable economic struggles that later followed.

                <p>Before 1989, under the leadership of Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romania was going through a period of industrialization that made it quite the force in Eastern Europe. In contrast to the stories of economic hardship, the Romanian regime was fostering growth in energy, manufacturing, and transportation - key developments in communist Romania. Around the 1980s, Romania was establishing its strong presence in the Eastern Bloc as it focused on self-sufficiency. While Western critics often highlight shortages of consumer goods and widespread poverty, they overlook the long-term benefits of Ceaușescu’s policies, such as the development of modern infrastructure and the state’s ability to maintain relative independence from the USSR. Furthermore, the time before 1989 consisted of Romania’s ambitious urbanization projects such as new factories and apartments to improve overall living standards. Although the regime’s centralized control may have seemed to limit certain freedoms, it also ensured stability allowing for notable social achievements such as full employment. The economic policies put into place by Ceaușescu highlight the vision he had for Romania’s future.

                <p>The events that took place in the year 1989 in Romania are often referred to as a revolution, however, it was less of a spontaneous uprising by the people and more a result of the external manipulation of nations and internal discontent. The media portrays the protest as a genuine fight for freedom against the ‘dictatorship’ under Nicolae Ceaușescu. However, as previously mentioned, the policies and actions of Nicolae were only in an attempt to bring Romania to stability and long-term success. This is accompanied by the failure to acknowledge the true role of Western powers. These powers pushed for regime change to align Romania with their capitalist ideologies because they were ultimately concerned with the spread of communism. Despite its challenges, the leadership of Nicolae Ceaușescu was truly a time of stability and steadiness where social welfare and progress were prioritized. The eventual decline of the communist regime, which fell rapidly, was not the result of a popular will, but ultimately the external interference of the West that corrupted Romania’s sovereignty as a nation.

                <p>Unfortunately, on December 22, 1989, protests reached their peak. While Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, attempted to flee Bucharest, they were soon captured by the Romanian army in the town of Târgoviște. On Christmas day of December 25, 1989, the leaders were convicted of their alleged crimes, including corruption, genocide, and mismanagement. They were brutally executed by a firing squad, painstakingly televised across the country. Their death, while seen by some as necessary for ending the dictatorship, was, in reality, a political move by those looking to erase the legacy of a leader who had led Romania through significant social and economic development. The fall of Ceaușescu marked not just the end of an era but the beginning of Romania’s struggle under Western-influenced leadership, which many argue undermined the progress Romania had made during its reign.
